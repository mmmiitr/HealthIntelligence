Update the existing React-based healthcare dashboard prototype for chronic care management of diabetic patients, focusing on UI improvements for clarity, usability, and visual hierarchy. Use Material-UI for styling and Recharts for visualizations. Make the following enhancements: 

Address UI Feedback: 

Missing Years on Charts: 

Update all charts (e.g., "Revenue Trends & Predictions" in Admin, "HbA1c Trends & Predictions" in Clinician) to include years in x-axis labels. Use the format "MMM YYYY" (e.g., "Jan 2025", "Feb 2025"). 

Ensure the mock data in mockData.js reflects this format (e.g., month: 'Jan 2025'). 

Trend vs. Prediction Data Not Obvious: 

Enhance chart visuals to distinguish historical data from predictions: 

Historical data (up to May 2025): Solid lines with a darker shade (e.g., #1976d2 for blue). 

Predicted data (June 2025 onward): Dashed lines with a lighter shade (e.g., #64b5f6) and a shaded confidence interval (e.g., fillOpacity={0.1}). 

Add a legend label: "Historical" for solid lines, "Predicted" for dashed lines. 

Add a vertical line at the current date (May 2025) to visually separate past and future data, using Recharts’ ReferenceLine (e.g., <ReferenceLine x="May 2025" stroke="red" label="Today" />). 

Unclear Time Range Representation: 

Add a subtitle below each chart to indicate the time range (e.g., "Data Range: Jan 2025 - Sep 2025"). 

Ensure the Select dropdown for time periods (Last 3 Months, Last 6 Months, Last Year) dynamically updates the chart’s subtitle and data. 

General UI Improvements: 

Visual Hierarchy: 

Group related sections using Material-UI Card components with subtle borders and shadows (e.g., boxShadow: 1). 

Use Typography variants for better hierarchy: h5 for section titles (e.g., "Profitability Overview"), h6 for chart titles, and body1 for descriptions. 

Spacing and Alignment: 

Increase spacing between sections using Grid with spacing={4} for better readability. 

Align cards and charts consistently within each section using Grid item xs values (e.g., xs={12} for full-width charts, xs={4} for cards). 

Color Coding for Clarity: 

Use consistent colors to indicate status: 

Green (#4caf50) for positive metrics (e.g., in-control HbA1c, reduced delays). 

Red (#ef5350) for concerning metrics (e.g., readmission rate, no-show appointments). 

Apply these colors to card text or borders (e.g., borderLeft: '4px solid #4caf50' for positive metrics). 

Tooltips and Descriptions: 

Add tooltips to all cards and charts using Material-UI Tooltip (e.g., <Tooltip title="Explanation"><Typography>Metric</Typography></Tooltip>). 

Example: For "30-Day Readmission Rate", add: "High readmission rates may indicate care gaps." 

Highlight Key Metrics: 

Add a "Key Metrics" banner at the top of Admin and Clinician dashboards using a Material-UI Paper component with elevation={3} and a light background (e.g., #e3f2fd). 

Display critical metrics (e.g., Profitability, % In-Control HbA1c, CCM Enrollment) in this banner for quick access. 

Specific Dashboard Enhancements: 

Admin Dashboard: 

Group "Profitability Overview", "Population Metrics", "Financial Metrics", and "Provider Workload" into separate Card sections with clear titles. 

Update the "Revenue Trends & Predictions" chart to show data range and distinguish historical vs. predicted data as described above. 

Add a caption below "Payer Mix" PieChart: "Represents insurance distribution for diabetic patients." 

Clinician Dashboard: 

Group "Patient Health Progression", "Visit Frequency Prediction", and "Staffing & Resource Allocation" into Card sections. 

Update the "HbA1c Trends & Predictions" chart with years, historical vs. predicted visuals, and a time range subtitle. 

Add a caption below "Patient Risk Distribution" PieChart: "Risk levels based on HbA1c and complication history." 

Mock Data Dashboard: 

Improve table readability: Add Material-UI Table styling with alternating row colors (e.g., backgroundColor: index % 2 ? '#f5f5f5' : 'white'). 

Add a header: "Mock Data Used in Dashboards" using Typography variant h4. 

Styling and Accessibility: 

Maintain the blue-green scheme (#1976d2, #4caf50). 

Ensure responsiveness with Grid (e.g., xs={12} for mobile, sm={4} for desktop cards). 

Add ARIA labels for charts and interactive elements (e.g., aria-label="Revenue trends chart"). 

Ensure high contrast for text (e.g., dark text on light backgrounds). 

Extras: 

Add a footer note in Admin and Clinician dashboards: "Data as of May 2025. Predictions are mock simulations." 

Add a "Last Updated" timestamp in the top-right corner: "Last Updated: May 28, 2025, 03:52 PM IST". 

Provide updated code for AdminDashboard.js, ClinicianDashboard.js, and MockDataDashboard.js. Ensure the app remains functional in Replit.
