Update the existing React-based healthcare dashboard prototype for chronic care management of diabetic patients, reorganizing the order of information and flattening the tab structure. Use Material-UI for styling and Recharts for visualizations. Make the following changes while leaving all other functionality unchanged: 

Flatten Tab Structure: 

Remove the Admin tab and its nested Finance and Operation tabs. 

Add Finance and Operation as top-level tabs in the main navigation. 

New tab order: Summary, Finance, Operation, Clinician, Patient, Mock Data. 

Ensure all content from the Finance and Operation tabs (previously under Admin) is moved to their respective top-level tabs without changes to the content itself. 

Reorganize Order of Information: 

Finance Tab: 

Order sections as follows: 

Profitability Overview (Total Profit, Revenue, Care Management Alignment). 

Financial Metrics (Reimbursement, Cost, Actual Cost, Payer Mix). 

Predicted Revenue by Insurance Type and Demographics (LineChart). 

Add a section title above each: "Profitability Overview", "Financial Metrics", "Revenue Predictions" using Typography variant h5. 

Operation Tab: 

Order sections as follows: 

Population Metrics (# of Chronic Patients, Readmission Rate, etc.). 

Provider Workload (Panel Size, Avg Time to Next Appointment). 

Hidden Trends in Patient Flow (LineChart). 

Resource Allocation (BarChart). 

Service Utilization Trends (BarChart). 

Add a section title above each: "Population Metrics", "Provider Workload", "Patient Flow Trends", "Resource Allocation", "Service Utilization" using Typography variant h5. 

Clinician Tab: 

Order sections as follows: 

Average HbA1c (card). 

HbA1c Trends & Predictions (LineChart). 

Patient Risk Distribution (PieChart). 

Predicted HbA1c Progression (LineChart). 

Predicted Visit Frequency (BarChart). 

Patient Engagement (LineChart). 

Add a section title above each: "Key Metrics", "HbA1c Trends", "Risk Distribution", "Predicted Progression", "Visit Frequency", "Patient Engagement" using Typography variant h5. 

Summary Tab: 

Keep as the first tab for an overview. 

Order sections: Key Metrics (existing cards), Action Item (readmission rate card), Next Steps (recommendations). 

Patient and Mock Data Tabs: 

Keep the order of information as is, but add section titles for clarity (e.g., "Patient Overview" for Patient tab, "Mock Datasets" for Mock Data tab). 

General Updates: 

Update the "Last Updated" timestamp in all tabs: "Last Updated: May 28, 2025, 04:42 PM IST" or whatever latest time is applicable. 

Maintain styling (blue-green scheme: #1976d2, #4caf50), responsiveness with Grid, and accessibility (ARIA labels).
