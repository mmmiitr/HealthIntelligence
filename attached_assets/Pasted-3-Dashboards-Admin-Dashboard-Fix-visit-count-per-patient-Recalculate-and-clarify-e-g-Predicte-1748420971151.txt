3. Dashboards
Admin Dashboard:
Fix visit count per patient: Recalculate and clarify (e.g., "Predicted Visits: 3/patient" with explanation).
Debug the financial/operational toggle to switch data views correctly.
Update revenue trend chart: Add year to x-axis, use solid lines for past data, dashed lines with confidence intervals for future data.
Clinician Dashboard:
Add tooltip for average A1C: "Key indicator of blood sugar control."
Update A1C trends chart: Ensure relevance, add year to x-axis.
Include new metrics: Complication rates, patient adherence rates (e.g., in cards or small charts).
Patient Dashboard:
Keep as is: "Patient Dashboard - John Doe" placeholder.
Mock Data Dashboard:
Display raw data tables (10 rows each) for revenue, HbA1c, and visits datasets.
4. Mock Data
Create mockData.js with sample datasets:
Revenue: { month: 'Jan 2025', revenue: 10000, predictedRevenue: 12000, lowerCI: 11000, upperCI: 13000 }
HbA1c: { month: 'Jan 2025', avgHbA1c: 7.2, predictedHbA1c: 7.0 }
Visits: { month: 'Jan 2025', patientId: 'P001', visitCount: 2, predictedVisitCount: 3 }
Add a Select dropdown for time periods: Last 3 Months, Last 6 Months, Last Year.
5. AI/ML Models
Simulate predictions in mock data:
HbA1c: predictedHbA1c: 7.0 ± 0.2
Visit count: predictedVisitCount: 3 (Zero-Inflated Poisson)
Revenue: predictedRevenue: $12000 ± $1000
Show predictions in charts with dashed lines and shaded confidence intervals.
6. Additional Features
Include diabetes-specific metrics: HbA1c, complications, insulin usage.
Link outcomes to revenue: Add a card (e.g., "Lower HbA1c reduces hospitalization costs").
Ensure toggle customization works.
Add privacy notes: "HIPAA-compliant", "Data encrypted".
7. Styling
Use blue-green scheme (#1976d2, #4caf50).
Ensure responsiveness with Grid.
Apply Material-UI typography.
8. Accessibility
High contrast, ARIA labels for tabs/dropdowns, keyboard navigation.
9. Extras
Tooltips: "AI-driven predictions in production."
Mock Data note: "Consider adding: comorbidities, payer mix, regional trends."
