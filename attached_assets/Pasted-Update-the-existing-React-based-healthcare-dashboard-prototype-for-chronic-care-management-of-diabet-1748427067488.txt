Update the existing React-based healthcare dashboard prototype for chronic care management of diabetic patients, focusing on profitability, revenue, care management alignment, and new metrics to support increased inpatient inflow. Use Material-UI for styling and Recharts for visualizations. Incorporate mock data to simulate the new features. Make the following enhancements: 

Admin Dashboard Updates: 

Add a "Profitability Overview" section with cards for: 

Profitability: "Total Profit: $10,000 (Revenue - Costs)" with a tooltip: "Reflects revenue minus costs for diabetic patients." 

Revenue: Use existing revenue card. 

Care Management Alignment: "% Enrolled in CCM: 75%" with a tooltip: "Supports Chronic Care Management (CCM), the most common program for chronic care. Other programs can be supported." 

Add a "Population Metrics" section with cards for: 

of Chronic Patients Enrolled: "500 patients" 

of New Patients Enrolled: "50 patients" 

% of Patients with In-Control HbA1c (<7%): "65%" 

30-Day Readmission Rate: "8%" 

% No-Show Appointments: "12%" 

Avg Visits per Patient per Month: "2 visits" 

% of Visits by Telemedicine: "30%" 

% of High-Risk Patients: "20%" 

% Enrolled in CCM: "75%" 

CCM Revenue per Patient: "$150" 

Add a "Financial Metrics" section with cards for: 

Reimbursement per Patient per Month: "$200" 

Cost per Patient per Month: "$120" 

Actual Costs per Patient per Month: "$130" 

Payer Mix: PieChart with mock data (e.g., Medicare: 40%, Medicaid: 20%, Private: 30%, Other: 10%). 

Add a "Provider Workload" section with cards for: 

Panel Size per Provider: "150 patients" 

Avg Time to Next Appointment: "3 days" 

Avg Time to Third Next Available Appointment: "7 days" 

Update "Revenue Trends & Predictions" to include: 

Predictions by insurance type (e.g., Medicare vs. Private) and demographic segments (e.g., age groups). 

Mock forecast accuracy: "Within 5-10% of actuals" as a tooltip. 

Add a LineChart showing hidden trends in patient flow (e.g., seasonal spikes in visits). 

Clinician Dashboard Updates: 

Add a "Patient Health Progression" section: 

Card: "Predicted Health Progression Accuracy: 95%" with a tooltip: "Predicts HbA1c progression with over 95% accuracy." 

LineChart: Mock data for predicted HbA1c progression (e.g., stable, improving, declining) over the next quarter. 

Add a "Visit Frequency Prediction" section: 

Card: "Predicted Visit Frequency Accuracy: 95%" with a tooltip: "Predicts visits with over 95% accuracy to enable proactive staffing." 

BarChart: Mock data for predicted visits per patient (e.g., 2-3 visits per month). 

Add a "Staffing & Resource Allocation" section: 

Card: "Proactive Staffing Impact: Reduced delays by 15%" with a tooltip: "Based on predicted patient volumes." 

BarChart: Mock data for resource allocation (e.g., staff hours needed vs. available). 

Mock Data Dashboard Updates: 

Add new mock datasets (10 rows each) for: 

Population Metrics: { month: 'Jan 2025', chronicPatients: 500, newPatients: 50, inControlHbA1c: 65, readmissionRate: 8, noShowRate: 12, avgVisits: 2, telemedicineVisits: 30, highRisk: 20, ccmEnrolled: 75, ccmRevenue: 150 }. 

Financial Metrics: { month: 'Jan 2025', reimbursement: 200, cost: 120, actualCost: 130, payerMix: { medicare: 40, medicaid: 20, private: 30, other: 10 } }. 

Provider Workload: { month: 'Jan 2025', panelSize: 150, nextApptDays: 3, thirdNextApptDays: 7 }. 

Predictions: { month: 'Jan 2025', predictedHbA1c: 7.0, predictedVisits: 3, predictedRevenueMedicare: 5000, predictedRevenuePrivate: 3000 }. 

Update the note: "Consider adding: seasonal trends, demographic segments, telemedicine utilization patterns." 

General Enhancements: 

Ensure all predictions (e.g., patient volumes, reimbursements) include a mock accuracy note: "Within 5-10% of actuals." 

Add a static text in Admin Dashboard: "Supports Chronic Care Management (CCM) for diabetes. Other care programs can be supported on request." 

Maintain styling (blue-green scheme: #1976d2, #4caf50), responsiveness with Grid, and accessibility (ARIA labels). 

Provide updated code for AdminDashboard.js, ClinicianDashboard.js, and MockDataDashboard.js, along with mockData.js to include the new datasets. Ensure the app remains functional in Replit.
