Update the existing React-based healthcare dashboard prototype for chronic care management of diabetic patients, splitting the Admin view into separate Finance and Operation tabs instead of using a toggle switch. Use Material-UI for styling and Recharts for visualizations. Make the following enhancements: 

Split Admin View into Finance and Operation Tabs: 

Replace the financial/operational toggle in the Admin Dashboard with nested Material-UI Tabs for "Finance" and "Operation". 

Finance Tab: 

Include financial metrics: Profitability Overview (Total Profit, Revenue, Care Management Alignment), Financial Metrics (Reimbursement, Cost, Actual Cost, Payer Mix), Predicted Revenue by Insurance Type and Demographics (LineChart). 

Add a section title: "Financial Overview" using Typography variant h5. 

Operation Tab: 

Include operational metrics: Population Metrics (# of Chronic Patients, Readmission Rate, etc.), Provider Workload (Panel Size, Avg Time to Next Appointment), Hidden Trends in Patient Flow (LineChart), Resource Allocation (BarChart moved from Clinician Dashboard for better fit). 

Add a section title: "Operational Insights" using Typography variant h5. 

Ensure both tabs maintain the existing Select dropdown for time periods (Last 3 Months, Last 6 Months, Last Year). 

Enhance Chart Clarity: 

Add a time range subtitle to all charts missing it (e.g., "Hidden Trends in Patient Flow", "Predicted HbA1c Progression"): 

Format: "Data Range: [Start Month] - [End Month]" (e.g., "Data Range: Jan 2025 - Sep 2025"). 

Update dynamically based on the Select dropdown. 

Ensure all charts have a vertical ReferenceLine for the current date (May 2025) and distinguish historical vs. predicted data (solid vs. dashed lines). 

Enhance Summary Dashboard: 

Add a call-to-action card: "Action Item: Reduce 30-Day Readmission Rate (Current: 8%)" with a tooltip: "High readmission rates may indicate care gaps." 

Style the card with a border-left in red (borderLeft: '4px solid #ef5350'). 

General Updates: 

Update the "Last Updated" timestamp: "Last Updated: May 28, 2025, 04:20 PM IST". 

Maintain styling (blue-green scheme: #1976d2, #4caf50), responsiveness with Grid, and accessibility (ARIA labels).
