Update the existing React-based healthcare dashboard prototype for chronic care management of diabetic patients, addressing flaws from a user perspective (not UI/UX). Use Material-UI for styling and Recharts for visualizations. Make the following enhancements while leaving other aspects unchanged: 

Update Timestamp: 

Update the "Last Updated" timestamp in all tabs: "Last Updated: May 28, 2025, 05:29 PM IST". 

Add Critical Alerts: 

In the Summary tab, add a "Critical Alerts" section in a Paper component (elevation={3}, background #ef5350 for urgency): 

Alert 1: "30-Day Readmission Rate (8%) exceeds target of 5%." 

Alert 2: "No-Show Appointments (12%) exceeds target of 10%." 

Use Typography variant body1 for each alert. 

Populate Patient Tab: 

Update the Patient tab to show mock data for "John Doe": 

Add cards for: 

HbA1c: "6.8% (Last Measured: May 2025)". 

Recent Visits: "2 visits in May 2025". 

Medication Adherence: "85%". 

Add a section title: "Patient Overview - John Doe" using Typography variant h5. 

Add High-Risk Patient Details: 

In the Clinician tab, under "Risk Distribution", add a "High-Risk Patients" table using Material-UI Table: 

Columns: "Patient Name", "Risk Factor", "Action". 

Mock data (3 rows): 

Row 1: "Jane Smith", "HbA1c > 9%", "Schedule follow-up". 

Row 2: "Mark Jones", "Recent hospitalization", "Review care plan". 

Row 3: "Emily Davis", "Non-adherent", "Engage with reminders". 

Add a section title: "High-Risk Patients" using Typography variant h5. 

Contextualize Prediction Accuracy: 

For "Predicted HbA1c Progression" and "Predicted Visit Frequency" charts in the Clinician tab, add a tooltip: 

"Accuracy based on historical data; Predicted HbA1c: [value] ± 0.2 (95% confidence interval)" (e.g., "Predicted HbA1c: 7.0 ± 0.2"). 

"Accuracy based on historical data; Predicted Visits: [value] ± 0.5 (95% confidence interval)" (e.g., "Predicted Visits: 2 ± 0.5"). 

Enhance Payer Mix Insights: 

In the Finance tab, under "Payer Mix", add a "Payer Revenue Breakdown" table using Material-UI Table: 

Columns: "Payer", "Revenue". 

Mock data (4 rows): 

Medicare: "$5,000". 

Medicaid: "$2,000". 

Private: "$3,000". 

Other: "$1,000". 

Add a section title: "Payer Revenue Breakdown" using Typography variant h5.
