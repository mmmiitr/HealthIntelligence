I’ve reviewed the current version of your healthcare dashboard prototype at [https://323e1ef6-3dd0-495b-aca7-b9dbdca9e78f-00-1vrfy0312gwyr.worf.replit.dev/](https://323e1ef6-3dd0-495b-aca7-b9dbdca9e78f-00-1vrfy0312gwyr.worf.replit.dev/) and the feedback you provided earlier. The dashboard currently includes Admin, Clinician, Patient, and Mock Data tabs, with a focus on diabetes care management. The feedback highlighted issues such as fixing the financial/operational toggle, clarifying metrics like visit counts, adding years to chart axes, and refining the Mock Data section to show raw data only. Additionally, I’ve analyzed the provided document, "Summary of Revisions: Standards of Care in Diabetes-2024," to identify new elements that can enhance the dashboard.

Below is the prompt for Replit to improve the prototype based on your feedback and incorporate relevant updates from the ADA 2024 Standards of Care document.

### Prompt for Replit: Update Healthcare Dashboard Prototype

Update the existing React-based healthcare dashboard prototype for chronic care management of diabetic patients, addressing feedback and incorporating new elements from the ADA 2024 Standards of Care. Use Material-UI for styling and Recharts for visualizations. Focus on the following enhancements:

1. **Address Feedback**:
   - **Admin Dashboard**:
     - Fix the "Visit Count Prediction" metric (currently "4.2 visits/patient"): Replace with an integer value (e.g., "3 visits/patient") and add a tooltip: "Predicted average visits per patient for the next quarter based on Zero-Inflated Poisson model."
     - Fix the financial/operational toggle (`Switch` component): Ensure it switches between financial metrics (e.g., revenue trends) and operational metrics (e.g., visit counts, bed occupancy). Update state management to re-render the dashboard content correctly.
     - Update the "Revenue Trends & Predictions" `AreaChart`: Add years to x-axis labels (e.g., "Jan 2025", "Feb 2025"), use solid lines for historical data (up to May 2025), and dashed lines with shaded confidence intervals for future predictions (June 2025 onward).
   - **Clinician Dashboard**:
     - Add a tooltip to "Average HbA1c" card: "Average HbA1c measures long-term blood sugar control in diabetic patients. Lower values (<7%) reduce complication risks."
     - Update the "HbA1c Trends & Predictions" `LineChart`: Add years to x-axis labels (e.g., "Jan 2025", "Feb 2025"), and clarify the chart’s purpose with a subtitle: "Tracks population-level HbA1c trends to identify care gaps."
     - Add new metrics: Include "Complication Rate" (e.g., "12% of patients with neuropathy") and "Patient Adherence Rate" (e.g., "80% medication compliance") as new cards.
   - **Mock Data Dashboard**:
     - Remove visualizations (charts). Display raw data tables only, showing 10 rows for each dataset (Revenue, HbA1c, Visits) used in Admin and Clinician dashboards. Columns: 
       - Revenue: `month`, `revenue`, `predictedRevenue`, `lowerCI`, `upperCI`.
       - HbA1c: `month`, `avgHbA1c`, `predictedHbA1c`.
       - Visits: `month`, `patientId`, `visitCount`, `predictedVisitCount`.
   - **Patient Dashboard**: Keep unchanged (placeholder with "Patient Dashboard - John Doe").

2. **Incorporate ADA 2024 Standards of Care Updates**:
   - **Admin Dashboard**:
     - Add a card for "Cost Considerations": Highlight insulin and glucose monitoring device costs (Section 1), with a note: "Reflects 2024 updates on insulin price lowering."
     - Add a section for "Community Support Insights": Include a static text: "Community paramedics may enhance diabetes care (Section 1)."
   - **Clinician Dashboard**:
     - Add a card for "Bone Health Screening": "Screen patients for bone health risks (Section 4)" with a tooltip: "New 2024 recommendation to evaluate fracture risk factors."
     - Add a card for "Hypoglycemia Risk": "Assess hypoglycemia risk using CGM (Section 6)" with a tooltip: "Updated 2024 guidance to use CGM for prevention."
     - Add a table for "High-Risk Screening": Include columns for "Patient Name", "Risk Factor", and "Action" (e.g., "Jane Doe", "Prediabetes from antipsychotics", "Screen per Section 2").
     - Update "Patient Adherence Rate" card to include "Smoking Cessation": Add text: "Ask about tobacco/cannabis use (Section 5)" with a tooltip: "2024 update to address cannabis use in diabetes care."
   - **Mock Data Dashboard**:
     - Add a note: "Consider adding data on bone health risk factors, smoking status, and medication-induced prediabetes risk (Section 2, 4, 5 updates)."

3. **Mock Data Updates**:
   - Update `mockData.js` to include years in `month` fields (e.g., "Jan 2025"). Ensure 10 rows per dataset for the Mock Data view.
   - Example:
     - Revenue: `{ month: 'Jan 2025', revenue: 10000, predictedRevenue: 12000, lowerCI: 11000, upperCI: 13000 }`.
     - HbA1c: `{ month: 'Jan 2025', avgHbA1c: 7.2, predictedHbA1c: 7.0 }`.
     - Visits: `{ month: 'Jan 2025', patientId: 'P001', visitCount: 2, predictedVisitCount: 3 }`.

4. **Styling and Accessibility**:
   - Maintain the blue-green scheme (`#1976d2`, `#4caf50`).
   - Ensure responsiveness with Material-UI `Grid`.
   - Add ARIA labels for new cards and tables.

5. **Extras**:
   - Add tooltips for new elements: "Reflects ADA 2024 Standards of Care updates."
   - Update Mock Data note: "Consider adding: bone health, smoking status, medication-induced risks."

Provide updated code for `AdminDashboard.js`, `ClinicianDashboard.js`, `MockDataDashboard.js`, and `mockData.js`. Ensure the app remains functional in Replit.
